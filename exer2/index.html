            Hi, I am Sean Seguin. In terms of social good, I have dedicated a lot of my time toward helping people achieve their 
            career and academic goals. I always felt that exploration of various careers and allowing students to find their passion 
            was missing in schools. Through efforts with some friends, we made an effort to change that.
